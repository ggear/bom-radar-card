# Changelog

## v1.11.1 - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Applied a dedicated `carto_api_key` to both CARTO base and label tile requests using
  CARTO's documented `?key=` parameter, restoring watermark-free authenticated
  raster basemaps. This builds on the original CARTO key support contributed by
  [@bossanova808](https://github.com/bossanova808) in
  [#23](https://github.com/AshtonAU/bom-radar-card/pull/23).
- Kept CARTO credentials separate from the existing Stadia Maps and Esri
  `basemap_api_key`, so a key retained by an older CARTO configuration is never
  sent to CARTO after upgrading.
- Cleared both provider-specific basemap key fields in the visual editor
  whenever the provider changes so a key is not sent to a different service.
- Added the required OpenStreetMap credit to CARTO attribution and made the
  visible attribution control easier to read. The existing `show_attribution`
  option remains available and enabled by default.
- Restored Leaflet's pane stacking order and absolute marker positioning so
  the home marker remains above loaded map and weather tiles through redraws.

### Documentation

- Documented CARTO's free-key requirement and dedicated config field, cached
  watermark recovery, attribution terms, provider-specific key handling, and
  planned retirement of its raster basemap endpoints.

## v1.11.0 - 2026-08-16

v1.11.0 is a backward-compatible reliability release based on a fresh review
of BOM's current mapping services. It adds an optional radar-network coverage
overlay, improves publication-rollover and Home Assistant lifecycle handling,
and makes the card self-contained by bundling Leaflet. Existing configuration,
defaults, weather layers, and frame limits remain unchanged.

### Added

- Added an optional, default-off overlay that shades areas outside BOM's radar
  network coverage for rain rate and reflectivity, available in YAML and the
  visual editor without a runtime metadata request.

### Fixed

- Locked Home Assistant sections-grid rows to the fixed height derived from
  `map_height`, avoiding a resize affordance that could not resize the map.
- Made visual-editor configuration events bubble across the editor shadow root
  so Home Assistant wrappers can receive them reliably.
- Started three-hour forecast timelines at the next current or future cadence
  instead of briefly requesting an expired first frame during BOM rollovers.
- Prevented blank edge frames when BOM advances a publication window by
  validating its first and last timestamps with tiny WMTS tiles and shifting a
  confirmed rollover without reducing the configured frame count.
- Added a guarded browser-resize fallback so Leaflet remeasures after a hidden
  or backgrounded dashboard misses its `ResizeObserver` delivery.
- Prevented a browser error when Home Assistant disconnects or reconnects a
  lightning-enabled card immediately after a resize.
- Retried a failed BOM image tile once before using the transparent fallback,
  recovering from short-lived upstream edge errors without creating a loop.
- Kept the current radar visible during refreshes and failed or overlapping
  layer switches, preventing stale results, blank maps, or a layer label that
  did not match the displayed data.

### Changed

- Bundled Leaflet 1.9.4 into the card so every instance uses the same
  module-local map engine without downloading Leaflet from a third-party CDN or
  overwriting a global owned by Home Assistant or another card.
- Preserved existing configuration, defaults, and layer frame limits. The new
  radar-coverage overlay remains off unless explicitly enabled.

## v1.10.1 - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Preserved card-mod's injected host styles when Home Assistant reconnects a
  cached Lovelace view, preventing width constraints from disappearing and the
  radar from rendering wider after switching dashboard tabs.
- Kept Leaflet's cached map size stable while a container is hidden, and
  re-measured its padding-box size when it becomes visible or its responsive
  layout changes. This prevents stale framing during other visibility paths.

### Documentation

- Reworked the README into a shorter, grouped reference with clearer setup,
  configuration, recipes, layer, sizing, and troubleshooting guidance.

### Validation

- Passed the unit, coverage, build, package, dependency-audit, syntax, and
  committed-bundle parity checks.
- Passed the issue 17 browser lifecycle matrix on desktop, mobile, fractional
  device-pixel-ratio, and ResizeObserver-only configurations. The v1.10.0
  positive control reproduced the original failures while v1.10.1 did not.

## v1.10.0 - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Optional live Blitzortung lightning-strike overlay. When the
  [Blitzortung integration](https://github.com/mrk-its/homeassistant-blitzortung)
  is installed, recency-coloured strike dots are drawn on the radar (on by default).
  New options: `show_lightning`, `lightning_fade_minutes`, `lightning_pulse`,
  `lightning_dot_size`.

### Maintenance
- Updated the Rollup build tooling and lockfile to clear dev-dependency audit findings.

### Validation
- Verified the Blitzortung overlay with unit tests, a local Chromium smoke test,
  and the existing browser/all-layer regression harnesses.

## v1.9.0 - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Added BOM-native Snow and Frost significant-weather WMTS layers.

### Validation

- Verified Snow and Frost against the current BOM WMTS capabilities, live PNG tile content, and browser rendering through the bundled card.

## v1.8.0 - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Added a no-key `bom` basemap provider using the public BOM `basemap_default` and `basemap_dark` MapServer tiles verified against the current BOM map stack.
- Added `uv_max_daily`, a BOM-native daily maximum UV Index layer verified against the public WMTS endpoint.
- Added optional `show_bom_boundaries` support using BOM's public `state_borders` MapServer image tiles.
- Added optional `bom_reference_layers` support for verified BOM MapServer reference overlays: state borders, coastal areas, forecast districts, drainage divisions, railways, and lakes.

### Changed

- Changed the default basemap provider to BOM, with day/night auto mode using BOM's default and dark basemaps unless a provider/style is configured.
- Users who want the previous CARTO look can keep it by setting `basemap_provider: carto` and the preferred fixed `basemap_style`.

### Fixed

- Hardened refresh/playback handling so data refreshes stop and resume animation cleanly, ignore stale rebuilds, guard invalid frame indexes, and clear map-layer state during cleanup.
- Sanitized numeric YAML/editor config values before runtime use, including map height, zoom, opacity, frame count, and animation delays.
- Hardened provider/style/layer registry lookups so inherited object keys cannot be treated as valid configuration.
- Fixed Leaflet loader retry handling after a transient CDN/script-load failure.
- Hardened the CI workflow with read-only token permissions and pinned action commit references.

### Documentation

- Documented the BOM-native basemap provider.
- Documented the optional BOM reference overlays.

## v1.7.0 - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added optional `basemap_style: auto` mode, which uses Home Assistant's `sun.sun` state to switch between the provider's light daytime basemap and dark nighttime basemap.
- Added visual editor support for the auto day/night basemap style.

### Documentation

- Documented the new auto day/night basemap mode and updated release references for `v1.7.0`.

## v1.6.6 - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- Fixed excess whitespace under the card in Home Assistant masonry and sections views by making the layout size estimate match the rendered `map_height`.
- Stopped playback controls from adding phantom layout height. Playback is overlaid on the map, so it no longer changes the reserved card height.
- Fixed BOM capabilities loading so the request is only used from CORS-safe contexts. Home Assistant browser dashboards now go straight to generated current timestamps instead of attempting a known-blocked capabilities request before falling back.
- Rebuilt the card when Home Assistant calls `setConfig()` after the map is already initialized, keeping editor/runtime config changes aligned with the rendered map.
- Reset playback state during runtime rebuilds so a paused card cannot come back with stale controls or no visible way to resume.
- Updated the embedded card banner version to match the package release.

### Documentation

- Clarified how `map_height`, `getCardSize()`, and sections-grid rows relate to each other.
- Documented that unknown migrated keys are ignored, and that `overlay_transparency` and `show_scale` are not supported options for this card.
- Updated release references and issue-template version hints for `v1.6.6`.

## v1.6.5 - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Fixed Home Assistant sidebar / SPA navigation returning to a dashboard with the card stuck in the loading state.
- Delayed card initialization until the element is connected and both config and Home Assistant state are available.
- Added lifecycle tokens so stale async initialization, Leaflet loading, and radar data loading cannot update a card after it has been disconnected and reconnected.
- Cleaned up partially-created Leaflet maps when initialization fails so a later retry can start from a clean state.
- Re-invalidated Leaflet size after attach and resize so maps recover correctly in Home Assistant sections views and hidden-to-visible dashboard layouts.
- Guarded BOM tile fallback completion so tile error fallback cannot call Leaflet's tile completion callback more than once.

### Verification Notes

- Verified with local Node regression checks for detached config/state setup, connected-first setup, SPA detach/reconnect, stale async initialization, stale radar data loading, partial map cleanup, and BOM tile fallback completion.
- Verified with browser lifecycle and live visual harnesses using real Leaflet, CARTO basemap tiles, and BOM WMTS tile requests.
- CI verifies the production bundle builds and committed `dist/bom-radar-card.js` remains current.

### Verified

- `npm run build`
- `node --check src/bom-radar-card.js`
- `git diff --check`
- `npm audit --omit=dev`
- `npm ci --dry-run`
- Browser preview with real map tiles
- Browser lifecycle harness
- Browser live harness covering overlay switching, timestamp labels, zoom, recenter, detach/reattach, hidden-to-visible, and narrow layout behavior

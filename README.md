# BOM Radar Card

Home Assistant custom card for **native Australian Bureau of Meteorology radar and weather map layers**, built on BOM's current WMTS platform and using the same public map stack that powers [bom.gov.au](https://www.bom.gov.au).

This card exists as a modern replacement for older Home Assistant BOM radar cards that depended on the discontinued `api.weather.bom.gov.au` stack.

Current release: **v1.10.0**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you previously installed another BOM radar card, remove its HACS entry and dashboard resource before adding this one. Home Assistant can keep multiple similarly named Lovelace resources loaded at the same time, which can cause broken or unpredictable behaviour. After switching cards, do a hard refresh / clear browser cache so the new resource is actually loaded.

## Latest Release

`v1.10.0` adds an optional live Blitzortung lightning overlay, with recency-coloured strike dots, fade controls, and visual editor support when the Blitzortung integration is installed.

The default `basemap_style: auto` still follows Home Assistant's `sun.sun` state for day/night switching. Users who prefer the previous CARTO look can keep it with `basemap_provider: carto`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.

## Highlights

- **Native BOM WMTS tiles** from `api.bom.gov.au`, with no API key required
- **Interactive map and animation** with zoom, pan, play/pause, scrubbing, and automatic refresh
- **Broad BOM layer support** including observed rain, forecast rain, wind, waves, temperature, humidity, UV, thunderstorms, snow, fog, and frost
- **In-card layer switcher** so people can move between available layers without reconfiguring the card
- **Built-in radar legend** for rain rate and reflectivity layers
- **Configurable presentation** with toggles for playback, legend, zoom, recenter, layer switcher, marker, attribution, and more
- **Optional live Blitzortung lightning overlay** with recency colours, fade controls, and no effect unless the Blitzortung integration is installed
- **Optional BOM reference overlays** for state borders, forecast districts, coastal areas, drainage divisions, railways, and lakes
- **BOM-native default basemap** with day/night styles, plus optional CARTO, Stadia Maps, and Esri providers
- **Visual editor support** for normal day-to-day configuration in Home Assistant

## How It Works

The card uses BOM's WMTS time-series tile service and loads 256x256 PNG tiles as map overlays. In Home Assistant browser dashboards, BOM's capabilities XML endpoint currently rejects requests that include a browser `Origin` header, so the card uses per-layer generated timestamps for normal operation. In CORS-safe contexts, the published WMTS time dimension parser is still available and rejects stale or stalled capability data before falling back. The basemap is rendered underneath the weather overlay; providers with separate label tiles keep suburb and city names above the overlay where available.

**Data flow:**
1. Use generated current timestamps in normal Home Assistant browser dashboards
2. Use fresh published WMTS capability timestamps only when the capabilities endpoint is reachable from a CORS-safe context
3. Load PNG tiles for each selected timestamp at the current map view
4. Animate through frames using the built-in playback controls
5. Auto-refresh periodically so the card stays aligned with BOM updates

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Open the three dots menu and choose **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/AshtonAU/bom-radar-card` with category **Dashboard**
4. Search for `BOM Radar Card` and install it
5. Hard refresh your browser after installation

### Manual

1. Download `bom-radar-card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/AshtonAU/bom-radar-card/releases) (`v1.10.0` at the time of writing)
2. Copy to `/config/www/bom-radar-card/bom-radar-card.js`
3. Add resource: **Settings → Dashboards → Resources → Add** `/local/bom-radar-card/bom-radar-card.js` (JavaScript Module)

## Configuration

Add the card to your dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
```

That's it — it will use your Home Assistant location as the default center.

### Sizing In Home Assistant

`map_height` is the card's rendered height. The playback bar, layer button, recenter button, legend, marker, and optional layer label are map overlays, so they do not add extra layout height.

Home Assistant uses `getCardSize()` for masonry dashboards and `getGridOptions()` for sections dashboards. Both layout hints are calculated from the same `map_height` value, with the sections view rounded to Home Assistant's 56 px row grid plus 8 px gaps. A small amount of rounding space can still appear in sections view because the Home Assistant grid is discrete, but enabling or disabling playback controls should not create a separate block of whitespace under the card.

### Lightning Overlay

When the [Blitzortung integration](https://github.com/mrk-its/homeassistant-blitzortung)
is installed, the card overlays its live lightning strikes on the radar, on by default.
Strikes are drawn as recency-coloured dots — white/yellow when fresh, fading through
amber to dark red — and disappear as the integration expires them. The feature is
completely inert when the integration is not installed. Turn it off with
`show_lightning: false`. Lightning data &copy; [Blitzortung.org](https://www.blitzortung.org).

### Compatibility Notes

The card ignores unknown YAML keys so existing dashboards keep loading when users migrate from another radar card. Use `radar_opacity` for the BOM weather overlay; older keys from other cards such as `overlay_transparency` are not used. `show_scale` is also not a supported option in this card.

### Example

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
center_latitude: -33.87
center_longitude: 151.21
zoom_level: 7
layer: reflectivity
map_height: 350
basemap_provider: bom
basemap_style: auto
frame_delay: 400
radar_opacity: 0.7
chrome_opacity: 0.9
show_marker: true
show_layer_switcher: true
square_style: false
```

### Auto Day/Night Basemap

Set `basemap_style: auto` to have the card use a light default basemap while the sun is above the horizon and a dark default basemap after sunset:

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
basemap_provider: bom
basemap_style: auto
```

Auto mode uses Home Assistant's `sun.sun` state, so the switch follows the sunrise and sunset times for your Home Assistant location. If `sun.sun` is unavailable, the card falls back to the legacy `dark_basemap` default. The default BOM provider uses `basemap_default` during the day and the verified `basemap_dark` MapServer tiles after sunset.

### Theme-Following Basemap

Set `basemap_style: theme` to have the card follow the active Home Assistant theme's light/dark mode instead of the sun. When the theme is light the card uses the provider's light style; when it is dark it uses the provider's dark style:

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
basemap_provider: bom
basemap_style: theme
```

The light/dark style pairs used are `default`/`dark` for `bom`, `light`/`dark` for `carto`, `alidade_light`/`alidade_dark` for `stadia`, and `topo`/`imagery` for `esri`. Providers without a light/dark pair simply use their default style. If Home Assistant's theme dark-mode state is unavailable, the card falls back to the light basemap.

### BOM Reference Overlays

If you want BOM's own map reference tiles drawn above the weather layer, enable the optional boundaries overlay:

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
show_bom_boundaries: true
```

For more map context, choose one or more verified BOM reference overlays:

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
bom_reference_layers:
  - state_borders
  - forecast_districts
  - coastal_areas
```

Available reference overlays are `state_borders`, `coastal_areas`, `forecast_districts`, `drainage_divisions`, `railways`, and `lakes`. They use BOM's public MapServer image tiles and are off by default so existing dashboards keep their current appearance.

### Optional Overzoom

If you want a closer local view without waiting for a separate local-radar mode, you can enable experimental overzoom:

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
layer: reflectivity
zoom_level: 10
allow_overzoom: true
```

This does **not** add extra native BOM radar detail. It simply allows the card to scale BOM's native `z8` radar tiles up to a display zoom of `10`, which can be useful for local inspection but may look softer than BOM's dedicated local `64 km / 128 km` radar products.

### Basemap Providers

- `bom`: default option, BOM-native light/dark map tiles, no API key required
- `carto`: no API key required
- `stadia`: optional styles including smoother road/terrain maps and satellite imagery
- `esri`: optional imagery/topographic styles

To keep the previous CARTO look after upgrading, set `basemap_provider: carto` and choose the fixed `basemap_style` you prefer, such as `dark` or `light` (CARTO Voyager).

`basemap_api_key` is optional in the config, but Stadia Maps and Esri may require a valid key depending on the selected style and the environment the card is hosted from.

BOM and CARTO are the no-key options. The BOM provider uses public BOM map tile services observed and verified against the current BOM map stack, including `basemap_default` and `basemap_dark`. Both Stadia Maps and Esri offer free-tier access, but the exact limits and which styles are included can vary by provider plan.

Important notes:

- `localhost` testing is not the same thing as a normal Home Assistant install on a LAN hostname or IP. A provider that appears keyless in local testing may still require a key for real users.
- Stadia Maps authentication requirements vary by host setup, and some styles may be plan-dependent.
- Esri also has an authenticated API-key path for their modern basemap services, even if some legacy tile endpoints appear to work anonymously.
- If Stadia styles fail with an auth or tile-loading error in Home Assistant, the first thing to try is adding a real key or configuring Stadia domain auth for your HA URL.

### Getting Basemap Provider Keys

`bom` and `carto` do not need a key.

For `stadia` and `esri`, the card uses the single `basemap_api_key` field. Only the currently selected provider uses that key.

#### Stadia Maps

Use this if the Stadia styles error in Home Assistant, or if your card is being served from a LAN IP / hostname / domain instead of `localhost`.

1. Create a free Stadia Maps account.
2. Open the Stadia client dashboard and select the property/site you want to use.
3. Under authentication settings, either:
   - generate an API key, or
   - configure domain-based authentication for your Home Assistant URL
4. Paste the API key into `basemap_api_key` if you are using key auth.

- [Client dashboard](https://client.stadiamaps.com/)
- [Pricing](https://stadiamaps.com/pricing/)

#### Esri / ArcGIS

Use this if you want the Esri styles to work consistently with an authenticated setup.

1. Create an ArcGIS Location Platform or ArcGIS Online account.
2. Create API key credentials using Esri's current API key flow.
3. Generate an API key with basemap access.
4. Paste that API key into `basemap_api_key`.

Helpful links:

- [API keys and security](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/security-and-authentication/api-key-authentication/)
- [Create an API key tutorial](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/security-and-authentication/api-key-authentication/tutorials/create-an-api-key/online/)
- [Basemap Styles service](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/basemap-styles/)

Note: Esri legacy API keys are being retired, so use the current API key credentials flow rather than older legacy-key docs.

### UI Polish And Accent Controls

- `chrome_opacity` lets you soften or strengthen the card chrome without affecting the weather overlay itself
- `chrome_style` picks the palette for the map-overlay controls
- `accent_color` controls the UI highlight color for playback/progress/focus states
- `location_color` controls the GPS/home marker independently from the rest of the UI

By default, the card uses a neutral light UI accent and keeps the location marker tied to your Home Assistant accent color.

The map-overlay controls are dark by default so they stay legible over the standard dark radar basemap. If you switch to a light basemap the dark controls can look heavy, so set `chrome_style: auto` to have the controls follow the resolved basemap — light controls over a light basemap and dark controls over a dark one — or pin them with `chrome_style: light` or `chrome_style: dark`:

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
basemap_style: light
chrome_style: auto
```

The transparency set by `chrome_opacity` and your `accent_color` highlights (active timeline dots, focus rings, spinner) are preserved in every mode.

### Limiting The Layer Switcher

If you want the in-card layer switcher to show only a smaller curated set, use `enabled_layers`:

```yaml
type: custom:bom-radar-card
layer: reflectivity
enabled_layers:
  - reflectivity
  - rain_rate
  - accumulation_1hr
  - wind_speed_kmh
  - air_temperature
```

## Available BOM Layers

| Layer ID | Category | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `rain_rate` | Rain / observed | Rain rate in mm/h |
| `accumulation_1hr` | Rain / observed | Estimated 1-hour rainfall accumulation |
| `accumulation_24hr` | Rain / observed | Accumulated 24-hour rainfall total |
| `reflectivity` | Rain / observed | Raw radar reflectivity in dBZ (default) |
| `forecast_rain_50pct_3hr` | Rain / forecast | 50% chance forecast rain amount, 3-hourly |
| `forecast_rain_50pct_daily` | Rain / forecast | 50% chance forecast rain amount, daily |
| `forecast_rain_25pct_3hr` | Rain / forecast | 25% chance forecast rain amount, 3-hourly |
| `forecast_rain_25pct_daily` | Rain / forecast | 25% chance forecast rain amount, daily |
| `forecast_rain_10pct_3hr` | Rain / forecast | 10% chance forecast rain amount, 3-hourly |
| `forecast_rain_10pct_daily` | Rain / forecast | 10% chance forecast rain amount, daily |
| `forecast_rain_chance_3hr` | Rain / forecast | Chance of at least 0.2 mm, 3-hourly |
| `forecast_rain_chance_daily` | Rain / forecast | Chance of at least 0.2 mm, daily |
| `wind_speed_kmh` | Wind | Wind speed in km/h |
| `wind_speed_kt` | Wind | Wind speed in knots |
| `wind_direction` | Wind | Wind direction |
| `wave_total_height` | Waves | Total wave height |
| `swell_1_height` | Waves | Swell 1 height |
| `swell_1_direction` | Waves | Swell 1 direction |
| `swell_2_height` | Waves | Swell 2 height |
| `swell_2_direction` | Waves | Swell 2 direction |
| `wind_wave_height` | Waves | Wind wave height |
| `air_temperature` | Temperature | Air temperature |
| `feels_like` | Temperature | Feels like temperature |
| `temperature_max_daily` | Temperature | Daytime maximum temperature |
| `temperature_min_daily` | Temperature | Overnight minimum temperature |
| `heatwave_severity` | Temperature | Heatwave severity |
| `relative_humidity` | Humidity & UV | Relative humidity |
| `dew_point` | Humidity & UV | Dew point temperature |
| `uv_index` | Humidity & UV | UV Index |
| `uv_max_daily` | Humidity & UV | Daily maximum UV Index |
| `thunderstorms` | Significant weather | Thunderstorm overlay |
| `snow` | Significant weather | Snow overlay |
| `fog` | Significant weather | Fog overlay |
| `frost` | Significant weather | Frost overlay |

`show_legend` currently applies to the rain rate and reflectivity layers, where BOM exposes a qualitative rain-intensity legend. Forecast, accumulation, wind, waves, temperature, humidity, UV, and significant-weather layers still render without an inline legend for now.

Observed radar layers animate backward through recent past timestamps. Forecast and daily layers start from the earliest available current/forward timestamp and advance through BOM's forecast horizon.

All of the card chrome is optional, so you can keep the full interactive layout or strip it back to a much cleaner map by disabling things like the layer switcher, layer badge, zoom controls, recenter button, playback bar, and attribution.

## Why Not RainViewer?

The popular `weather-radar-card` uses RainViewer, which reprocesses BOM data and adds another layer between Home Assistant and the original source. This card pulls **directly from BOM's own tile service** instead, which means:

- **Higher fidelity radar imagery**
- **Less delay between BOM updates and what you see**
- **More BOM-native layers**, including reflectivity, observed rainfall, forecast rain, wind, waves, temperature, humidity, UV, and significant-weather overlays
- **Australian-specific bounds and tile handling** instead of a generic global weather view

## Technical Details

- **Data source**: BOM WMTS at `api.bom.gov.au`
- **Tile format**: 256×256 PNG with transparency
- **Projection**: BOM's Australian-extent WMTS TileMatrixSets based on EPSG:3857
- **Max zoom**: Level 8 by default, or optional display zoom up to 10 with experimental overzoom enabled
- **Map library**: Leaflet.js 1.9.4 (loaded from CDN)
- **Basemap**: BOM native default/dark map tiles by default, plus optional CARTO, Stadia Maps, and Esri providers
- **Update cycle**: 5 minutes
- **Bundle size**: ~60KB minified
